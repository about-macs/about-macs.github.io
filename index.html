            The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-<br>
            in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until<br> 
            the latter was discontinued in 1993.<br>
            <br>
            Early Macintosh models were expensive, hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper<br>
            Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses, <br>
            although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. <br>
            Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC<br>
            manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-<br>
            competitive with Wintel machines at the time.<br>
            <br>
            However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor, which beat the Motorola 68040 used in then-current <br>
            Macintoshes in most benchmarks, gradually too market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third <br>
            place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh <br>
            line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh <br>
            Performa, and the release of Windows 95 contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base.<br
            <br>
            Upon his return to the company, Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models<br>
            in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1"<br>
            PowerBook G3, and 12" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high<br>
            performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability.<br>
            <br>
            Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", a nickname that had been in common use<br>
            since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based.<br>
            <br>
            Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook<br>
            Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.<br>
            <br>
            Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the "Macintosh System Software" in <br>
            1988, "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called "Classic Mac OS". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh<br>
            called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-<br>
            Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX<br>
            Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.<br>
            <br>
            In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current <br>
            version is  macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019. Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and<br> 
            Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple <br>
            computers.<br>
            <br>
            The Macintosh family of computers have operated using a variety of different CPU architectures since its introduction. Originally they used the Motorola 68000 <br>
            series of microprocessors. In the mid 1990s they transitioned to PowerPC processors, and again in the mid 2000s they began to use 32- and 64-bit Intel x86<br>
            processors. Apple has confirmed that it will be transitioning CPU architectures again, this time to its own ARM-based processors for use in the <br>
            Macintosh beginning in 2020.<br>

         <p class="text">The Macintosh project began in 1979 when Jef Raskin, an Apple employee, envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to<br>
            name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same<br>
            spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the newly <br>
            spelled name, thus allowing Apple to use it. The request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use this name. A 1984 Byte Magazine
            article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after "early users" misspelled "McIntosh".However, Jef Raskin had adopted the "Macintosh" spelling by 1981, 
            when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab.

                    In 1978 Apple began to organize the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced <br>
                    Apple II or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979 Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces<br>
                    (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in <br>

                    the art for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a <br>
                    case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 16/32-bit Motorola <br>
                    68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs and made a software <br>
                    GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs's continual <br>
                    suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979, Jef Raskin started the Macintosh project. The design at <br>
                    that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-<br>
                    based user interface that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command<br>
                    keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring <br>
                    for the project in September 1979, and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him. His initial<br>
                    team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, and Bud Tribble. The rest <br>
                    of the original Mac team would include Bill Atkinson, Bob Belleville, Steve Capps, George Crow, Donn Denman, Chris Espinosa,<br>
                    Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with Steve Jobs leading the project. In a<br>
                    2013 interview, Steve Wozniak insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the<br>
                    Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, at which<br>
                    point Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh "failed" under Jobs and that it was<br>

                    <p class="text">not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John <br>
                    Sculley "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".<br>
                    <br>
                    Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit<br>
                    Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud<br>
                    Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh and<br>
                    asked Smith whether he could incorporate Lisa's 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost<br>
                    down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 but increased its <br>
                    speed from Lisa's 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design<br>
                    used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made the production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final <br>
                    Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 KB of ROM – far more<br>
                    than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8 KB of ROM; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit<br>
                    (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Although there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by<br>
                    means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's<br>
                    screen was a 9-inch (230 mm), 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    Burrell's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000<br>
                    CPU, began to receive Jobs's attentions. InfoWorld in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa <br>
                    and "McIntosh" projects at Apple. Stating that they and another computer "are all scheduled to be ready for release within a year", it<br>

                    that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, Jobs began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in<br>
                    1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final <br>
                    Macintosh design is closer to Jobs's ideas than Raskin's. When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted<br>

                        In 1982 Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh. Later the Regis McKenna<br>
                        team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, who eventually led the Apple account for the<br>
                        agency. Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan. The launch of the<br>
                        Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the "multiple<br>
                        exclusive," event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique about a<br>
                        product and giving an inside look into a product's creation.<br>
                        <br>
                        After the Lisa's announcement, John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious "MacIntosh" project at Apple in February <br>
                        1983. The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont, California—in October 1983, followed by<br>
                        an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December. The Macintosh was introduced by<br>
                        a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on<br>
                        January 22, 1984, and is now considered a "watershed event" and a "masterpiece". McKenna called the ad "more<br>
                        successful than the Mac itself." "1984" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a<br>
                        Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the "conformity" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry.<br>
                        The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother."<br> 
                        <br>
                        Two days after "1984" aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere "toy."[39] Because the operating system was designed largely for the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985.[40] In 1985 Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.[41] Apple introduced the Macintosh Office suite the same year with the "Lemmings" ad. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.[42]Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of Newsweek,[43] and ran a "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from $1,995 to $2,495 (equivalent to $5,900 in 2019).[3][42] The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year; one dealer reported a backlog of more than 600 orders.[44][45] By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.
