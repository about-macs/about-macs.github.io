            The <strong>Macintosh</strong> (commonly shortened to <strong>Mac</strong> since 1998)is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured, and <br>
            sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984. <br>

            The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-<br>
            in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until<br> 
            the latter was discontinued in 1993.<br>
            <br>
            Early Macintosh models were expensive, hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper<br>
            Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses, <br>
            although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. <br>
            Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC<br>
            manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-<br>
            competitive with Wintel machines at the time.<br>
            <br>
            However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor, which beat the Motorola 68040 used in then-current <br>
            Macintoshes in most benchmarks, gradually too market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third <br>
            place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh <br>
            line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh <br>
            Performa, and the release of Windows 95 contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base.<br
            <br>
            Upon his return to the company, Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models<br>
            in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1"<br>
            PowerBook G3, and 12" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high<br>
            performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability.<br>
            <br>
            Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", a nickname that had been in common use<br>
            since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based.<br>
            <br>
            Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook<br>
            Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.<br>
            <br>
            Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the "Macintosh System Software" in <br>
            1988, "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called "Classic Mac OS". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh<br>
            called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-<br>
            Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX<br>
            Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.<br>
            <br>
            In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current <br>
            version is  macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019. Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and<br> 
            Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple <br>
            computers.<br>
            <br>
            The Macintosh family of computers have operated using a variety of different CPU architectures since its introduction. Originally they used the Motorola 68000 <br>
            series of microprocessors. In the mid 1990s they transitioned to PowerPC processors, and again in the mid 2000s they began to use 32- and 64-bit Intel x86<br>
            processors. Apple has confirmed that it will be transitioning CPU architectures again, this time to its own ARM-based processors for use in the <br>
            Macintosh beginning in 2020.<br>
