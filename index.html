            The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-<br>
            in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until<br> 
            the latter was discontinued in 1993.<br>
            <br>
            Early Macintosh models were expensive, hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper<br>
            Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses, <br>
            although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. <br>
            Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC<br>
            manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-<br>
            competitive with Wintel machines at the time.<br>
            <br>
            However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor, which beat the Motorola 68040 used in then-current <br>
            Macintoshes in most benchmarks, gradually too market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third <br>
            place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh <br>
            line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh <br>
            Performa, and the release of Windows 95 contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base.<br
            <br>
            Upon his return to the company, Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models<br>
            in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1"<br>
            PowerBook G3, and 12" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high<br>
            performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability.<br>
            <br>
            Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", a nickname that had been in common use<br>
            since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based.<br>
            <br>
            Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook<br>
            Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.<br>
            <br>
            Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the "Macintosh System Software" in <br>
            1988, "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called "Classic Mac OS". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh<br>
            called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-<br>
            Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX<br>
            Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.<br>
            <br>
            In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current <br>
            version is  macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019. Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and<br> 
            Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple <br>
            computers.<br>
            <br>
            The Macintosh family of computers have operated using a variety of different CPU architectures since its introduction. Originally they used the Motorola 68000 <br>
            series of microprocessors. In the mid 1990s they transitioned to PowerPC processors, and again in the mid 2000s they began to use 32- and 64-bit Intel x86<br>
            processors. Apple has confirmed that it will be transitioning CPU architectures again, this time to its own ARM-based processors for use in the <br>
            Macintosh beginning in 2020.<br>
        </p>
        <h2 id="name">Naming</h2>
         <p class="text">The Macintosh project began in 1979 when Jef Raskin, an Apple employee, envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to<br>
            name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same<br>
            spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the newly <br>
            spelled name, thus allowing Apple to use it. The request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use this name. A 1984 Byte Magazine
            article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after "early users" misspelled "McIntosh".However, Jef Raskin had adopted the "Macintosh" spelling by 1981, 
            when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab.

                    In 1978 Apple began to organize the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced <br>
                    Apple II or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979 Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces<br>
                    (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in <br>
                    action. The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the state of <br>

                    the art for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a <br>
                    case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 16/32-bit Motorola <br>
                    68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs and made a software <br>
                    GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs's continual <br>
                    suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979, Jef Raskin started the Macintosh project. The design at <br>
                    that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-<br>
                    based user interface that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command<br>
                    keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring <br>
                    for the project in September 1979, and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him. His initial<br>
                    team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, and Bud Tribble. The rest <br>
                    of the original Mac team would include Bill Atkinson, Bob Belleville, Steve Capps, George Crow, Donn Denman, Chris Espinosa,<br>
                    Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with Steve Jobs leading the project. In a<br>
                    2013 interview, Steve Wozniak insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the<br>
                    Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, at which<br>
                    point Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh "failed" under Jobs and that it was<br>

                    <p class="text">not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John <br>
                    Sculley "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".<br>
                    <br>
                    Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit<br>
                    Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud<br>
                    Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh and<br>
                    asked Smith whether he could incorporate Lisa's 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost<br>
                    down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 but increased its <br>
                    speed from Lisa's 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design<br>
                    used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made the production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final <br>
                    Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 KB of ROM – far more<br>
                    than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8 KB of ROM; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit<br>
                    (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Although there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by<br>
                    means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's<br>
                    screen was a 9-inch (230 mm), 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    Burrell's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000<br>
                    CPU, began to receive Jobs's attentions. InfoWorld in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa <br>
                    and "McIntosh" projects at Apple. Stating that they and another computer "are all scheduled to be ready for release within a year", it<br>

                    that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, Jobs began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in<br>
                    1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final <br>
                    Macintosh design is closer to Jobs's ideas than Raskin's. When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted<br>

                        In 1982 Regis McKenna was brought in to shape the marketing and launch of the Macintosh. Later the Regis McKenna<br>
                        team grew to include Jane Anderson, Katie Cadigan and Andy Cunningham, who eventually led the Apple account for the<br>
                        agency. Cunningham and Anderson were the primary authors of the Macintosh launch plan. The launch of the<br>
                        Macintosh pioneered many different tactics that are used today in launching technology products, including the "multiple<br>
                        exclusive," event marketing (credited to John Sculley, who brought the concept over from Pepsi), creating a mystique about a<br>
                        product and giving an inside look into a product's creation.<br>
                        <br>
                        After the Lisa's announcement, John Dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious "MacIntosh" project at Apple in February <br>
                        1983. The company announced the Macintosh 128K—manufactured at an Apple factory in Fremont, California—in October 1983, followed by<br>
                        an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December. The Macintosh was introduced by<br>
                        a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on<br>
                        January 22, 1984, and is now considered a "watershed event" and a "masterpiece". McKenna called the ad "more<br>
                        successful than the Mac itself." "1984" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a<br>
                        Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the "conformity" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry.<br>
                        The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother."<br> 
                        <br>
                        Two days after "1984" aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: MacWrite and MacPaint. It was first<br>
                        demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a<br>
                        mere "toy." Because the operating system was designed largely for the GUI, existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the<br>
                        programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial<br>
                        lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, Microsoft's MultiPlan migrated over from MS-DOS, with Microsoft Word following in January 1985. In 1985 Lotus<br>
                        Software introduced Lotus Jazz for the Macintosh platform after the success of Lotus 1-2-3 for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop. Apple introduced the<br>
                        Macintosh Office suite the same year with the "Lemmings" ad. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.<br>
                        <br>
                        Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of Newsweek, and ran a "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion, in which<br>
                        potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked<br>
                        the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing<br>
                        campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from $1,995 to $2,495 (equivalent to $5,900 in 2019). The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly<br>
                        outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year; one dealer reported a backlog of more than 600 orders. By April 1984 the company sold 50,000<br>
                        Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.<br>

                        Most Apple II sales had once been to companies, but the IBM PC caused small businesses, schools, and some homes to become Apple's main customers. Jobs<br>
                        stated during the Macintosh's introduction "we expect Macintosh to become the third industry standard", after the Apple II and IBM PC. Although outselling every other<br>
                        computer, and so compelling that one dealer described it as "the first $2,500 impulse item", Macintosh did not meet expectations during the first year, especially among<br>
                        business customers. Only about ten applications including MacWrite and MacPaint were widely available, although many non-Apple software developers<br>
                        participated in the introduction and Apple promised that 79 companies including Lotus, Digital Research, and Ashton-Tate were creating products for the new computer.<br>
                        After one year for each computer, the Macintosh had less than one-quarter of the PC's software selection—including one word processor, two databases, and one<br>
                        spreadsheet—although Apple had sold 280,000 Macintoshes compared to IBM's first-year sales of fewer than 100,000 PCs. MacWrite's inclusion with the Macintosh<br>
                        discouraged developers from creating other word processing software. <br>
                        <br>
                        Although Macintosh excited software developers, they were required to learn how to write software that used the graphic user interface, and early in the<br>
                        computer's history needed a Lisa 2 or Unix system to write Macintosh software. Infocom had developed the only third-party games for the Mac's launch by replacing<br>
                        the buggy early operating system with the company's own minimal bootable game platform. Despite standardizing on Pascal for software development Apple did not<br>
                        release a native-code Pascal compiler. Until third-party Pascal compilers appeared, developers had to write software in other languages while still learning enough<br>
                        Pascal to understand Inside Macintosh. <br>

                        The Macintosh 128K, originally released as the Apple Macintosh, is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. Its beige case consisted of a 9 in (23 cm) CRT<br>
                        monitor and came with a keyboard and mouse. A handle built into the top of the case made it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. This was synonymous with<br>
                        the release of the iconic 1984 TV Advertisement by Apple. This model and the 512k released in September of the same year had signatures of the core team embossed<br>
                        inside the hard plastic cover and soon became collector pieces.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 1985 the combination of the Mac, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's MacPublisher and Aldus PageMaker enabled users to<br>
                        design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as desktop publishing. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to<br>
                        the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms. Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, QuarkXPress, and Adobe's Photoshop and<br>
                        Illustrator strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market. <br>

                        The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be<br>
                        expanded easily. It also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to<br>
                        address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's<br>
                        16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984 Apple<br>
                        introduced the Macintosh 512K, with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195. It also offered an<br>
                        upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board.<br>

                            Apple released the Macintosh Plus on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one megabyte of RAM, easily<br>

                            Mac Pro that was introduced on December 19, 2013 surpassed this record on September 18, 2018. In September 1986 Apple<br>
                            introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or MPW, an application that allowed software developers to create<br>
                            software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than cross compiling from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled HyperCard<br>
                            and MultiFinder, which added cooperative multitasking to the operating system. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.<br>

                            Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology<br>
                            and introduced the Macintosh II at $5500, powered by a 16 MHz Motorola 68020 processor. The primary improvement in the<br>
                            Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine.<br>
                            Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple<br>
                            monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open<br>
