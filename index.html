            The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-<br>
            in screen, and mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of computers for almost ten years until<br> 
            the latter was discontinued in 1993.<br>
            <br>
            Early Macintosh models were expensive, hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper<br>
            Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses, <br>
            although they were less expensive than the Xerox Alto and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. <br>
            Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC<br>
            manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-<br>
            competitive with Wintel machines at the time.<br>
            <br>
            However, the introduction of Windows 3.1 and Intel's Pentium processor, which beat the Motorola 68040 used in then-current <br>
            Macintoshes in most benchmarks, gradually too market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third <br>
            place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh <br>
            line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the Macintosh <br>
            Performa, and the release of Windows 95 contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base.<br
            <br>
            Upon his return to the company, Steve Jobs led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models<br>
            in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1"<br>
            PowerBook G3, and 12" iBook. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high<br>
            performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability.<br>
            <br>
            Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", a nickname that had been in common use<br>
            since the development of the first model. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based.<br>
            <br>
            Its current lineup includes four desktops (the all-in-one iMac and iMac Pro, and the desktop Mac Mini and Mac Pro), and two laptops (the MacBook Air and MacBook<br>
            Pro). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.<br>
            <br>
            Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the "Macintosh System Software" in <br>
            1988, "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called "Classic Mac OS". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh<br>
            called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-<br>
            Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX<br>
            Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.<br>
            <br>
            In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current <br>
            version is  macOS Catalina, released on October 7, 2019. Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and<br> 
            Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple <br>
            computers.<br>
            <br>
            The Macintosh family of computers have operated using a variety of different CPU architectures since its introduction. Originally they used the Motorola 68000 <br>
            series of microprocessors. In the mid 1990s they transitioned to PowerPC processors, and again in the mid 2000s they began to use 32- and 64-bit Intel x86<br>
            processors. Apple has confirmed that it will be transitioning CPU architectures again, this time to its own ARM-based processors for use in the <br>
            Macintosh beginning in 2020.<br>

         <p class="text">The Macintosh project began in 1979 when Jef Raskin, an Apple employee, envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to<br>
            name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh, but the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same<br>
            spelling as that used by McIntosh Laboratory, Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer. Steve Jobs requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the newly <br>
            spelled name, thus allowing Apple to use it. The request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use this name. A 1984 Byte Magazine
            article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after "early users" misspelled "McIntosh".However, Jef Raskin had adopted the "Macintosh" spelling by 1981, 
        </p> when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab.

                    In 1978 Apple began to organize the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced <br>
                    Apple II or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979 Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces<br>
                    (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in <br>
                    action. The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the state of <br>

                    the art for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a <br>
                    case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 16/32-bit Motorola <br>
                    68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs and made a software <br>
                    GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs's continual <br>
                    suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979, Jef Raskin started the Macintosh project. The design at <br>
                    that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a text-<br>
                    based user interface that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command<br>
                    keys on the keyboard that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring <br>
                    for the project in September 1979, and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him. His initial<br>
                    team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, Joanna Hoffman, Burrell Smith, and Bud Tribble. The rest <br>
                    of the original Mac team would include Bill Atkinson, Bob Belleville, Steve Capps, George Crow, Donn Denman, Chris Espinosa,<br>
                    Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce Horn, Susan Kare, Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with Steve Jobs leading the project. In a<br>
                    2013 interview, Steve Wozniak insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the<br>
                    Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, at which<br>
                    point Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh "failed" under Jobs and that it was<br>
                    <img src="https://github.com/about-macs/about-macs.github.io/blob/main/image.png?raw=true"><br>
                    not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John <br>
                    Sculley "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".<br>
                    <br>
                    Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64 kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit<br>
                    Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud<br>
                    Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh and<br>
                    asked Smith whether he could incorporate Lisa's 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost<br>
                    down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 but increased its <br>
                    speed from Lisa's 5 MHz to 8 MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design<br>
                    used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made the production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final <br>
                    Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64 KB of ROM – far more<br>
                    than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8 KB of ROM; it had 128 kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit<br>
                    (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Although there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512 kB by<br>
                    means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256 kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's<br>
                    screen was a 9-inch (230 mm), 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.<br>
                    <br>
                    Burrell's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an Apple II with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000<br>
                    CPU, began to receive Jobs's attentions. InfoWorld in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa <br>
                    and "McIntosh" projects at Apple. Stating that they and another computer "are all scheduled to be ready for release within a year", it<br>

                    that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, Jobs began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in<br>
                    1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final <br>
                    Macintosh design is closer to Jobs's ideas than Raskin's. When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted<br>
